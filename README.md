# Efficient Frontier with Diversification Penalty

This project simulates and visualizes efficient portfolios using historical stock data while applying a diversification penalty to discourage highly correlated holdings.

---

## üß© Features
- Fetches stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Simulates thousands of random portfolios using Monte Carlo methods.
- Computes annualized return, volatility, and a *penalized* Sharpe ratio.
- Identifies:
  - Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio
  - Minimum Volatility portfolio
- Interactive visualization of the Efficient Frontier using Plotly.

## üß† The Diversification Penalty
Traditional portfolio optimization ignores correlation between assets.  
Here, the Sharpe ratio is penalized for portfolios with high pairwise correlations:

\[
\text{Penalized Sharpe} = \frac{R_p}{\sigma_p} - \lambda \cdot \bar{\rho}
\]

where:
- \( R_p \): portfolio return  
- \( \sigma_p \): portfolio volatility  
- \( \bar{\rho} \): average weighted correlation  
- \( \lambda \): penalty strength (tunable parameter)

This encourages selecting portfolios with uncorrelated assets, promoting diversification.
